          I got the Software Engineering Certification from Springboard. I completed a 700+ hour online course covering front-end, back-end, and full stack web development 
          with JavaScript, Python, Flask, SQL, Node, Express, React, and Redux. I completed 4 fullstack capstone projects. 
          Also I worked with Github, and Heroku for deploying apps. In this course I was in contact with a large group of classmates to solve problems, work pair programming. 
          Also I have a bachelor degree in computer engineering, and I have more than 10 years experience as an IT administrator. 
          My responsibility was overseeing and maintaining all aspects of a computer infrastructure including maintaining networks, 
          servers and security programs and systems. Also I managed the upgrade and installation of new hardware and software, 
          and performed troubleshooting. 
          Now I have over a year of experience as a software engineer at Springboard, and Iâ€™m looking for a job as a full stack developer, front end developer, back end developer. I can speak 3 languages: English, Persian, Turkish.
